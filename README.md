Hi there!

This is a React calculator project made for studying purposes.

In this project, I used React.js and its hook useReducer, so no additional library is involved. The calculator is fully functional, and number formatting is enabled.

Techniques used: useState, useReducer hooks

If you have any suggestions, feel free to share :)
